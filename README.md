# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

Intro
This project is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict customer churn in the banking sector. It enables businesses to anticipate which customers are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be found in several open-source repositories. It contains anonymized information about bank customers including demographics, account information, and transaction behavior.

About Data
The dataset includes the following key attributes:

Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, geography)

Account details (e.g., credit score, balance, number of products)

Behavioral metrics (e.g., tenure, active status)

Target variable indicating whether a customer has churned

The data is cleaned, preprocessed, and fed into machine learning models to predict the likelihood of churn.
